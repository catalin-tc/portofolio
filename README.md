# Portofolio - Work in Progress

Hi, I am Catalin, a senior full stack web developer, currently enjoying the freelancing life! Now that you found your way here, please enjoy perusing my projects!

As you navigate through these projects, my passion for tackling complex challenges will become obvious, along with my commitment to deliver high-quality outcomes.

From simple browser-only applications and classic CRUD web apps to complex realtime based solutions, electron based apps and even progressive web apps.

### Chorissimo - Revolutionizing Chore Management

Chorissimo, a family chore management app, brings technology to everyday's life. This application streamlines and gamifies the chores in the house, making them enjoyable for everyone, fostering colaboration and accountability.

This application is a PWA built upon the following stack

- Angular
- NestJS
- Supabase
- Angular Material + CDK
- TailwindCSS
- Storybook

### Hangman - A Digital Twist on a Classic

Hangman is a much beloved word-guessing game that I brought into the digital realm. Featuring numerous thematic elements, difficulty configurations and making good use of the browser features, I am sure you will find this game very enjoyable.

This is a PWA application build upon the following stack

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Storybook

### Snake - Or a lesson in using the canvas

Snake, the timeless classic, becomes a lesson in canvas management. While Hangman is a static game, where pure HTML is more than enough, for a dynamic game like snake, I need to introduce the `<canvas>` element to my toolbelt.

Snake is built upon a simple PWA React shell, and leverages different programming techniques for the management of the canvas element.

### ReactiveComm - Peer-to-peer communication on the web

ReactiveComm is my take on a peer-to-peer communication app. It leverages tons of features, encryption, back-ups and so much more.

This application is also a PWA created with:

- Angular
- TailwindCSS
- Storybook
- NestJS
